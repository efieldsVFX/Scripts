# Multi-threaded Texture Pipeline Tool

## Overview
A high-performance, production-grade texture importing system designed for large-scale VFX pipelines. This tool demonstrates advanced pipeline development skills including multi-threading, UI development, and robust error handling in a production environment.

## Technical Highlights

### Architecture
- **Multi-threaded Processing**: Implements ThreadPoolExecutor for parallel texture processing
- **Thread-safe Design**: Utilizes mutex locks for concurrent operations
- **Event-driven Architecture**: Built on Qt's event system for responsive UI
- **Modular Design**: Separates concerns between UI, processing, and IO operations

### Key Features
- Concurrent texture importing with progress tracking
- Real-time progress visualization through Qt-based UI
- Automated folder structure creation
- Robust error handling and logging system
- Memory-efficient large batch processing

### Technical Implementation
- **Qt Integration**: Custom Qt dialogs for selection, confirmation, and progress tracking
- **Thread Management**: Sophisticated worker system with proper cleanup and resource management
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of failed imports with detailed logging
- **Memory Management**: Efficient handling of large texture sets through streaming

## User Interface

### Texture Selection Interface
![Texture Selection](docs/images/texture_selection.png)

The texture selection interface provides a hierarchical view of your project assets:
- **Descriptor**: High-level asset categories (e.g., Environments)
- **Asset Build**: Specific asset variations or versions
- **Object**: Individual components within assets

#### Features
- Tree-based navigation for intuitive asset browsing
- Multi-select capability for batch processing
- Smart filtering of texture sets
- Real-time validation of selections

### Material Preview

The material preview window shows real-time results in Unreal Engine:
- **Parameter Controls**: Fine-tune material properties
- **Texture Mapping**: Visual confirmation of texture assignments
- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate feedback on changes
- **Quality Checks**: Visual validation of texture imports

## Integration with Asset Creator

The texture tools work seamlessly with the Asset Creator pipeline:
1. **Asset Setup**: Asset Creator establishes the project structure
2. **Texture Import**: Texture tools handle material creation and setup
3. **Quality Control**: Built-in validation ensures texture compliance
4. **Pipeline Sync**: Automatic synchronization with asset management

### Workflow Example
```python
# Integration with Asset Creator
from asset_tools.asset_creator import AssetCreator
from texture_tools.importer import TextureImporter

# Setup asset structure
asset_creator = AssetCreator(project="ProjectName")
asset_creator.create_asset_structure()

# Import and setup textures
texture_importer = TextureImporter()
texture_importer.import_textures(
    asset_path=asset_creator.get_asset_path(),
    create_materials=True
)
```

## Production Benefits
- **Pipeline Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with existing production workflows
- **Artist Experience**: Intuitive UI reduces technical barriers
- **Performance**: Significantly reduces texture import times through parallel processing
- **Maintenance**: Well-documented, modular code for easy updates and modifications

## Technologies
- Python 3.x
- PySide2 (Qt)
- Threading and Concurrency
- Unreal Engine Integration

## Pipeline Integration Example
```python
# Register with pipeline core
def register(core):
    core.register_tool('texture_importer', run_texture_importer)
```

## Future Enhancements
- Expandable to support additional texture formats
- Potential for distributed processing across render farm
- Integration with asset versioning systems
