1gywa7d,Testing. ,"MASSIVE UPDATE: 

Intrigued by OPs questions and what I learned last night research, I got up early and did more research, wondering why this Department of all would be targeted for dissolution.  TL;DR: Culture War, but also please change my mind.     But first, a few disclaimers: 

1. I am biased. It’s important to always assume that data presented to you is biased and incomplete.  In this case, I can assure you that this posting, and the post I made last night, are both biased and incomplete.   My biases are as diverse as my own background: 

\- An extended family that includes religious white conservatives,  but also gay, black and hispanic members and at least three religions in our family

\- Being a registered Democrat, 

\-Being the beneficiary of Federal Education loans and grants, the beneficiary of Federal benefits such as the GI Bill, a VA hone loa

\- Surely many, many others biases that I am probably not even aware of - that is, I am human and approaching this topic from a point of genuine curiosity, but am still tainting it with my own beliefs. 

2. This is incomplete, and I’m just a random internet guy.  I assure that despite the length of my post, is it vastly incomplete and non-authoritative.   I have no scholarly nor professional tangents to Education other than my time as a student in the American public school system and our University system.    I have not taken the time to research the protocols of academic study and writing, and make no attempt here to be exhaustive.  I am a dude on the internet just googling stuff and writing.  I would love professional educators, critics, policy makers or others with more insight, experience and data to respond; please counterpoint, underscore, expand or negate; this is how we learn. 

3. Some of the text in here is directly pasted from official archive scans of originally printed material.  It is subject to the limitations of OCR and resulted in many words being incorrectly interpreted, and formatting issues.  I have cleaned those up as much as possible. 

4. Finally, Reddit’s inline editor just sucks when dealing with large comments.  It fails continuously, providing zero use feedback into the cause of failure other than just “Something went wrong”.  I have written this outside of Reddit and am simply copying and pasting into Reddit’s editors.  I have embedded sources into my text  but am unapologetically not creating HREF’s out of them in Reddit’s editor.  Since they are full URLs your browser surely will.  Personally I prefer formatting in this way as you can see the source without having to click on its display text.  It has taken me a non-trivial number of attempts at formatting this in a way it likes to get it to save. 

Now, my major update: 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I had originally written that the Department of Education was formed in 1979 by Carter, but it was actually originally created by Andrew Jackson in 1867.  This Politico Article titled “Kill the Department of Ed. ? It’s been done.”  explores the formation of the Department and how it immediately became embroiled in Reconstruction Era politics of Federal versus States power, and unsurprisingly, race politics as the South did strove to maintain the vestiges of slavery. [https://www.history.com/news/black-codes-reconstruction-slavery](https://www.history.com/news/black-codes-reconstruction-slavery).   The original Department, with only 4 employees tasked with merely gathering data, was  shuttered very shortly after its formation.  



For the next hundred years, the Federal government stepped in with individual Acts for Education reform as crisis response. This does not mean that it was ignored at the Federal level; in 1946 Harry Truman formed the President’s Commission on Higher Education, which resulted in the 1947 paper “Higher Education for American Democracy”. (United States Archives [https://ia801506.us.archive.org/25/items/in.ernet.dli.2015.89917/2015.89917.Higher-Education-For-American-Democracy-A-Report-Of-The-Presidents-Commission-On-Higher-Education-Vol-I---Vi\_text.pdf](https://ia801506.us.archive.org/25/items/in.ernet.dli.2015.89917/2015.89917.Higher-Education-For-American-Democracy-A-Report-Of-The-Presidents-Commission-On-Higher-Education-Vol-I---Vi_text.pdf)) .  This itself seems to be spurred by crisis as the the report frequently cites frustrating ineffective, resourcing shortfalls and other issues amongst increased demand as veterans return home from World War II with their newly formed “G.I. Bill of Rights” and the “Veterans Rehabilitation Act”. 

A critical aspect of this report is the section “BARRIERS TO EQUAL OPPORTUNITY” which plainly states

“One of the gravest charges to which American society is subject is that of failing to provide a reasonable equality of educational opportunity for its youth and girls, the kind and amount of education they may hope to atain depends, not on their own abilities, but on the family or community into which they happened to be born or, worse still, on the color of their skin or the religion of their parents.”

As part of this section, the report explores the regional variances in education, drawing correlation between state income and youth population to its educational quality.  In this section it highlights the high population growth in the South coupled with its low income and the correlation to reduced spending per student and states that “The greater number of children being born in the families and the regions of the country that are least able to provide them with a good education at home or in school is contributing to the spread of a meager cultural heritage, and this may one day tip the balance in our struggle for a better civilization.”  It plainly states the need for increased Federal contributions for education, effectively to subsidize states that were unable to provide for themselves: “The only possible solution of the problem is, as rapidly as possible, to raise economic and cultural levels in our less advanced areas, and in the meantime to provide outside assistance that will enable these areas to give their children equal educational opportunities with all others in the Nation.”

  Additionally, in Chapter III, the report explores Discrimination in Higher Education; racial, religious, and “other arbitrary exclusions” including “Anti-Feminism in Higher Education”. In this chapter, it explores rising enrollment numbers but also the effects of segregation.  In this section, the report cites  the Supreme Court Gaines decision [https://www.thirteen.org/wnet/jimcrow/stories\_events\_gaines.html](https://www.thirteen.org/wnet/jimcrow/stories_events_gaines.html)  that requires the states to build equal facilities (“separate, but equal” per Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896)for black students, but immediately contends that segregation still resulted in de facto discrimination: “Although segregation may not legally mean discrimination as to the quality of the facilities it usually does so in fact.” and that  “The schools maintained for the Negroes \[sic\] are commonly much inferior to those for the whites. The Negro schools are financed at a pitifully low level, they are often housed in buildings wholly inadequate for the purpose, and many of the teachers are sorely in need of more education themselves. Library facilities are generally poor or lacking altogether, and professional supervision is more a name than a reality.”  The report also states that segregation doesn’t just hurt the educational quality for black students, but for white ones as well. 

 “Segregation lessens the quality of education for the whites as well\* To maintain two school systems side by side duplicating even inadequately the buildings, equipment, and teaching personnel means that neither can be of the quality that would be possible if all the available resources were devoted to one system, especiaUy not when the States least able financially to support an adequate educational program for their youth are the very ones that are trying to carry a double load.” 

It then goes on to study the effects of the quota system (used on black and jewish students), and the lack of opportunity for women”

This was the 40’s leading into the 50’s, when school segregation was a front line battle for civil rights for all Americans, and landmark cases like Mendez vs Westminster [https://newsroom.ocde.us/the-final-ruling-in-mendez-v-westminster-which-ended-sanctioned-school-segregation-came-75-years-ago-today/](https://newsroom.ocde.us/the-final-ruling-in-mendez-v-westminster-which-ended-sanctioned-school-segregation-came-75-years-ago-today/) were forcing reform across the country.   At the same time, the Republican Party was forming its Southern Strategy [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern\_strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy) aimed at activating white southern voters; certainly putting them at odds with this report.  It is important to note, however, that the stance of the parties on core issues have flip flopped over time, and that a contemporary party agenda may not necessarily be aligned with their agenda decades or a century ago. 

Fast forward to the late 70’s.  When Carter formed the Department again, he cited the Federal government’s own ineffectiveness in promoting State education at the time:  [https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/department-education-organization-act-statement-signing-s-210-into-law](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/department-education-organization-act-statement-signing-s-210-into-law)

“Instead of assisting school officials at the local level, it has too often added to their burden. Instead of setting a strong administrative model, the Federal structure has contributed to bureaucratic buck passing. Instead of stimulating needed debate of educational issues, the Federal Government has confused its role of junior partner in American education with that of silent partner.”

Carter, who was the first Presidential candidate ever endorsed by the National Education Association - essentially a Teachers union - was immediately rebuked by Congress, but successful in forming the Department. [https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2015/09/department-of-education-history-000235/](https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2015/09/department-of-education-history-000235/)

This new Department of Education now provided general funding to the states, but coupled with constraints as Federal funding often is.  This was publicly criticized early on for its homogenization of curriculum, de-prioritization of vocational education.  Even famed composer and musician Frank Zappa had something to say about it in the 80s:  ““After all the student rebellions in the 60s, civics was banished from the student curriculum and was replaced by something called social studies. Here we live in a country that has a fabulous constitution and all these guarantees, a contract between the citizens and the government – nobody knows what’s in it,”  (As quoted by the Augusta Press [https://theaugustapress.com/column-carters-folly-the-department-of-education/](https://theaugustapress.com/column-carters-folly-the-department-of-education/) )

Jump to the 80s, and Ronald Reagan campaigned with promises of destroying the Department, and a focus on empirical results versus spending alone: [https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/public/2021-08/Reagan%2C%20Ronald%20W.%20--%20Promises%20Made%2C%20Promises%20Kept.pdf](https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/public/2021-08/Reagan%2C%20Ronald%20W.%20--%20Promises%20Made%2C%20Promises%20Kept.pdf)

*""Many schools \[are\] placing a new emphasis on quality and discipline, more homework, more attention to basic skills, more attention to what works, that* is *to results. This \[is) truly revolutionary after two decades in which money had been the only measureof progress in education.* . .""

\- April26,1988,remarks upon receiving the publication *American Education:Making* it Work

That is not to say that Reagan deprioritized education in the US - in fact under his administration we saw the introduction of merit pay for teachers, and magnet schools, and a rise in average SAT scores.  

Jump forward to the 2020’s, and the Department of Education is still characterized as “dictating curriculum” although I have trouble finding any articulation of that - it seems to be just a generalized complaint. The Dept of Ed’s charter does not include curriculum development, it is not funded for curriculum development, nor does it appear to have any operations in that realm.   It does, however, provide money in three different ways, one of which are discretionary grants which sometimes have stated objectives aligned towards its charter of providing enhanced education and \*access\*.  As an example, this grant’s objective is to increase the assessment capabilities .  However, it provides clear traceability to legislation - in this case George H Bush’s No Child Left Behind Act.  It is unclear if the DOE actually has any ability to provide funds and objectives on its own without supporting legislation. 

[https://www.ed.gov/grants-and-programs/formula-grants/school-improvement/competitive-grants-for-state-assessments#Home](https://www.ed.gov/grants-and-programs/formula-grants/school-improvement/competitive-grants-for-state-assessments#Home)

It could be that these funding objectives - which seems to be legislated, not the result of regulatory law, could be conflated as dictating curriculum.  

Indeed, most modern grievances in fact seem to stem from “Title IX” or the  Education Amendment Act of 1972.  This act, predating  Carter’s creation of the Department, is US CODE, not regulatory code, and  was written by legislators, proposed by legislators, passed by legislators and signed into law by sitting Republic President Richard Nixon.  Title IX amends 20 USC (Education) Chapter 38. and provided for strong protections against discrimination in education based on sex. 

This act, aimed at removing sex discrimination in our educational system, further instructs Federal agencies in Section 1862 \\[https://www.justice.gov/crt/title-ix-education-amendments-1972](https://www.justice.gov/crt/title-ix-education-amendments-1972) to use their funding abilities to maintain alignment with this law: 

“Each Federal department and agency which is empowered to extend Federal financial assistance to any education program or activity, by way of grant, loan, or contract other than a contract of insurance or guaranty, is authorized and directed to effectuate the provisions of section 1681 of this title with respect to such program or activity by issuing rules, regulations, or orders of general applicability which shall be consistent with achievement of the objectives of the statute authorizing the financial assistance in connection with which the action is taken.” 

Fast Forward Another 30 years, and the Department’s regulatory constraints around funding expand, as does social awareness amongst many Americans.    President Obama’s administration expanded  regulatory attachments (not legislative) to include required pursuits of sexual harassment claims.  This meant that educational institutions receiving Federal money were required to pursue sexual harassment claims as part of the codes anti-discrimination requirements. [https://www.ed.gov/sites/ed/files/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/titleix-regs-unofficial.pdf](https://www.ed.gov/sites/ed/files/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/titleix-regs-unofficial.pdf)

“The final regulations specify how recipients of Federal financial assistance covered by Title IX, including elementary and secondary schools as well as postsecondary institutions, (hereinafter collectively referred to as “recipients” or “schools”), must respond to allegations of sexual harassment consistent with Title IX’s prohibition against sex discrimination.”

While tolerance of sexual harassment could quite readily be seen as “soft discrimination” by many, this was immediately attacked by conservatives  [https://www.brookings.edu/articles/analyzing-the-department-of-educations-final-title-ix-rules-on-sexual-misconduct/](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/analyzing-the-department-of-educations-final-title-ix-rules-on-sexual-misconduct/)  .  It is important to note as well that during this time period  GOP had adopted a strategy led by Eric Cantor and Mitch McConnell of of staunch, sweeping  opposition to anything Obama attempted as their famed “Party of NO”. [https://swampland.time.com/2012/08/23/the-party-of-no-new-details-on-the-gop-plot-to-obstruct-obama/](https://swampland.time.com/2012/08/23/the-party-of-no-new-details-on-the-gop-plot-to-obstruct-obama/)

In 2020 the Supreme Court was composed of 6 judges appointed by Republic Presidents - including THREE appointed by Trump - and only 3 judges appointed by Democratic Presidents.  It is frequently referred to as the most conservative Supreme Court in modern history.  THIS Court in 2019 took the case Bostock Vs Clayton County, Georgia. and HELD that “An employer who fires an individual merely for being gay or transgender violates Title VII”. [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/17-1618\_hfci.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/17-1618_hfci.pdf)

We now have, at the highest court of the land under 6 conservative judges, ruling that discrimination of gay and transgender people  is illegal. The Department of Education updates it’s interpretations, and the Biden administration seeks to update regulatory law (which is separate from legislation) in 2022 [https://www.edweek.org/leadership/lgbtq-students-would-get-explicit-protection-under-title-ix-proposals/2022/06](https://www.edweek.org/leadership/lgbtq-students-would-get-explicit-protection-under-title-ix-proposals/2022/06) .  2 years later the regulatory changes are enacted: 

“The revised regulations for Title IX, the law outlawing sex discrimination at federally funded schools, expand the definition of sex-based discrimination and harassment to explicitly prohibit discrimination based on sex stereotypes, pregnancy or related conditions, sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex characteristics.”   [https://www.edweek.org/leadership/lgbtq-students-would-get-explicit-protection-under-title-ix-proposals/2022/06](https://www.edweek.org/leadership/lgbtq-students-would-get-explicit-protection-under-title-ix-proposals/2022/06)

The Department of Education is also frequently criticized for being overly bureaucratic.  While Ed. puts forth the vast majority of its money to funding programs, it is not without its internal challenges. A 2019 GAO report [https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-19-266r](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-19-266r) cites persistent problems with Oversight, Data Quality, Capacity and Study Design. Ed’s own OIG found issues in 2016 [https://www.oversight.gov/reports/audit/audit-departments-oversight-rural-education-achievement-program](https://www.oversight.gov/reports/audit/audit-departments-oversight-rural-education-achievement-program) that seem to underscore the GAO’s later findings: 

“We found that improvements were needed in the Department’s monitoring of Rural Education Achievement Program grantees’ performance and use of funds. We specifically noted that the Department conducted limited monitoring to determine whether grantees were making progress toward program goals or spending grant funds in accordance with statutory and regulatory guidelines. Instead, oversight efforts were primarily focused on ensuring grantees were obligating and spending funds by established deadlines. Although we concluded that the Department’s program monitoring could be improved, we found that the Department’s rural education coordination efforts appeared to be effective.” 

There are also plenty of complains about what could be described as the “user experience” with Ed, as highlighted in this article [https://www.heritage.org/education/commentary/why-do-federal-bureaucrats-have-so-much-power-over-our-education-system](https://www.heritage.org/education/commentary/why-do-federal-bureaucrats-have-so-much-power-over-our-education-system)

So now we see: 

\- Challenges in general performance, although how grievous they are compared to other departments is unknown to me. 

\- A frustrating, overly complex system of citizen interaction, which is very believable.

Both of these are easily remedied without dissolving the Department; updating systems, staffing, overhauling how it interacts with citizens and simple e-Gov enhancements could increase it’s performance and user engagement without the risk of disbanding it and rehoming it’s programs into other Departments.  Its current personnel spend is quite low, and I don’t think rehoming its programs would save much, if anything, in personnel and contract costs.   

We cannot ignore, however, the escalation of the American culture war in the last two decades.  Our two major national parties have become even more polar, with even many Democrats recognizing the hard left push of the DNC as overstepping [https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/15/centrist-democrats-chair-dnc-00189933](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/15/centrist-democrats-chair-dnc-00189933) which Trump famously exploited during his campaign targeting Transgenders  as one point amongst many in his escalation of the culture war.   


As we then look back at the history of Education Reform, we see: 

\- The first Department of Education was immediately snared in Reconstruction Era politics of certain states wanting to retain control, and active fights against racial equality. 

\- A Truman era paper calling out harmful effects of discrimination as states were still trying to defend segregation, 

\- A Nixon era law requiring Federal agencies to use their program dollars and regulatory laws to defeat sexual discrimination, 

\- Expanding definitions of sexual discrimination by a President that was vastly opposed in by an  obstructionist Congress, and escalation of the “culture wars”

\- Further expansion of the definitions of sexual discrimination, albeit by a very conservative Supreme Court, 

\- Codification of those definitions in regulation by a sitting President at the height of the “culture wars” 

\- The President elect heavily leveraging culture war and specifically attacking Transgenderism, amongst other topics, in his campaign. 

Without more input from others on actual inefficiencies or program challenges by Ed, I can only come to the personal conclusion as a result of this admittedly biased and incomplete research that it is being targeted as a victim of the Culture War, rightly or wrongly so, regardless of  whether dissolving the Department would actually have any impact on the legislation and Supreme Court decisions it is required by law to execute.  I am not firm in this stance, and welcome input to the contrary. 

Original post below:

I spent a bloody HOUR researching, writing and editing, only for Reddit to glitch out when I tried to submit it.  It doesn't save as it goes either, bloody dodgy tech, so I'm saving this comment and then editing it as I go.

\>What are the reasons to keep and eliminate the Department of Education?

Trump hasn't articulated many reasons other than ""returning power to the states"".  Mike Rounds, of South Dakota, has[ introduced legislation to abolish Ed under the same premise](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2024/11/21/mike-rounds-bill-to-cut-department-of-education/76487564007/), citing bureaucracy and ineffectiveness.   Given that Ed's primary function is to distribute dollars to the states, it's unclear what Round's or Trumps real motivations would be other than creating a visible political ""victory"" as returning power to the states have been a conservative goal for several lifetimes.

[South Dakota's own spend on students is some of the lowest in the country: 37th in revenue receipts per student, 44th in expenditures per student, and 49th in teach salaries.](https://doe.sd.gov/legislature/documents/2024/SchoolFunding-Snapshot.pdf)   South Dakota [does not provide increased funding for students from low-income households or for districts based on the concentrations of low-income students they serve.](http://funded.edbuild.org/state/SD)  It is unclear if these self-reported numbers are lamenting or boastful; it could be that Roads is motivated to get more funding directing to his constituency, or to be able to structure their education spend as they wish.

This issue [does not appear to be a core issue for Trump voters based on this Pew survey. ](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/10/10/expectations-about-harris-and-trump-as-president/)

\> In the event that the department is shut down, who is proposed to administer the Congressionally mandated programs it handles now?

Rounds does suggest rehoming the programs, but without clarifying where.  I have not seen anything from Trump suggesting rehoming.

\>What, if any, are the projected savings of eliminating the department?

This  Congressional Budget Office report titled [The Budgetary Implications of Eliminating a Cabinet Department](https://www.cbo.gov/content/budgetary-implications-eliminating-cabinet-department) states that personnel costs are an average of 12% of total costs across all 15 Cabinets.  For Education specifically, it's significantly lower: ""For some departments, such as the Department of Education, personnel costs are only a small percentage of their total budget because their primary responsibility is to administer grants or other activities that primarily provide money to state and local governments, individuals, or other entities.""

Table 6-1 **Direct Obligations for Grants and Fixed Charges, by Department, 2012**, shows that 96% of Eds obligations are directed to grants and fixed charges.

Table 6-3 goes into more detail about Ed spending:

53B in Grants and Fixed Charges - it's actual raison d'etre,

1.75B in Contractual Services and Supplies,

590M in Personnel Compensation and Benefits, and

6M in Acquisition of Assets.

The latter three provide the potential to save up to 2.4B with gained efficiencies, if possible.  Later in this CBO report they state what is now apparent:

""Eliminating a department could result in considerable budgetary savings to the federal government if some or all of the programs operated by that department were also terminated. The amount of savings would eventually be equal to the department’s full budget for the canceled programs, minus any income that the department had received through its operation of those programs. Initially, however, the government could incur one-time costs for terminating programs or activities, such as paying the cost of accrued annual leave and unemployment benefits to federal employees whose jobs had been eliminated or paying penalties for canceling leases for office space.

In contrast, eliminating a department while transferring its programs in essentially unchanged form to other departments or agencies would probably result in little or no budgetary savings, because most of the costs incurred by departments are the costs of the programs themselves. At best, simply transferring programs to another department might reduce administrative support costs, but in most cases, such costs are much smaller than the costs of direct program activities. In particular, 66 percent of the combined budgets of the 15 departments provides individuals, state and local governments, businesses, and organizations with grants, subsidies, insurance benefits, and interest payments—which all, or nearly all, constitute program costs; ""

In short, since Ed's dollars are primary just transferred to other jurisdictions, there is lesser opportunity for savings that with other Departments that provides services or goods.  They spend 96% of their money on the programs, and have only a couple billion in administrative costs that could be trimmed, and rehoming them to another department, without changing program funding to the states, may not create efficiency or savings.
