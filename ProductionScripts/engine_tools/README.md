- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time feedback during project launch
- **Logging System**: Detailed timestamped logging for debugging

## üîå Pipeline Integrations

### Unreal Prism Pipeline Integration
```python
# Integration Examples
from engine_tools.launcher import UnrealEngineLauncher

# Project initialization with Prism
launcher.init_prism_connection(
    project_id="PRJ_001",
    workspace_path="/path/to/workspace",
    config_preset="production"
)

# Asset synchronization
launcher.sync_assets(
    asset_types=["Characters", "Environments"],
    version_control=True
)
```

### ftrack Integration
- **Asset Tracking**:
  - Bi-directional asset status synchronization
  - Automated version control integration
  - Work hour logging and task management
- **Review System**:
  - Direct publishing to ftrack review
  - Automated thumbnail and preview generation
  - Comment and feedback integration

## üõ† Technical Specifications

## üîß Configuration
```yaml
# Example configuration
project_settings:
  engine_version: "5.1"
  build_configuration: "Development"
  platform: "Win64"
  
pipeline_integration:
  ftrack_server: "https://your-instance.ftrackapp.com"
  api_key: "${FTRACK_API_KEY}"
  
logging:
  level: "INFO"
  format: "%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s"
```

## üì¶ Building and Deployment

### PyInstaller Setup
The launcher can be compiled into a standalone executable using PyInstaller. This process bundles all necessary Python dependencies and resources into a single distributable package.

#### Requirements
```
PyQt5==5.15.9
PyInstaller==5.13.0
```

#### Using the Spec File
The provided `launcher.spec` file contains preconfigured PyInstaller settings optimized for the Unreal Launcher:

1. **Build with Spec File**:
   ```bash
   pyinstaller launcher.spec
   ```

The spec file includes:
- Resource bundling configuration
- Icon settings
- Windowed application mode
- UPX compression
- Proper binary collection

This method is preferred over direct command-line options as it ensures consistent builds with all necessary configurations.

#### Building Steps
1. **Install Build Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Create Executable**:
   ```bash
   pyinstaller --name="UnrealLauncher" ^
               --windowed ^
               --icon=resources/icon.ico ^
               --add-data="resources;resources" ^
               launcher.py
   ```

3. **Build Options**:
   - `--windowed`: Creates a windowed application without console
   - `--icon`: Specifies the application icon
   - `--add-data`: Includes additional resources
   - `--onefile`: (Optional) Creates a single executable file

The compiled executable will be available in the `dist` directory.

### Distribution Structure
```
UnrealLauncher/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ UnrealLauncher.exe
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ resources/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ icon.ico
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ themes/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ _internal/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [PyInstaller dependencies]
```

## üì¶ Packaging with PyInstaller

### Prerequisites
- PyInstaller (`pip install pyinstaller`)
- All dependencies installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)

### Building the Executable
1. Navigate to the engine_tools directory:
```bash
cd ProductionScripts/engine_tools
```
2. Run PyInstaller with the following command:
```bash
pyinstaller --name="UnrealLauncher" --windowed --icon=resources/icon.ico --add-data="resources/*;resources/" launcher.py
```
### Build Options Explained
- `--name`: Specifies the output executable name
- `--windowed`: Creates a Windows executable without console window
- `--icon`: Sets the application icon
- `--add-data`: Includes resource files in the executable

The packaged executable will be created in the `dist/UnrealLauncher` directory.

### Verifying the Build
1. Navigate to `dist/UnrealLauncher`
2. Run `UnrealLauncher.exe`
3. Verify all functionality works as expected

### Troubleshooting
- If resources are not found, ensure the `resource_path()` function is used correctly
- For missing dependencies, check the generated `warn-launcher.txt` file
- Run with console to see error messages: Remove `--windowed` flag during testing

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Basic Project Launch
```python
launcher = UnrealEngineLauncher()
launcher.launch_project("ProjectName", config="development")
```

### Pipeline Integration
```python
# Initialize with ftrack
launcher.connect_ftrack(
    project_id="PRJ_001",
    task_id="TASK_123"
)

# Launch with tracking
launcher.launch_tracked_session(
    project="ProjectName",
    task_type="Layout",
    auto_timer=True
)
```
