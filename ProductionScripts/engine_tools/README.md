## üöÄ Overview
Advanced toolset for seamless integration of Unreal Engine within professional VFX and game development pipelines. Designed to streamline workflow automation, asset management, and production tracking.

### üéÆ Unreal Engine Launcher
A sophisticated PyQt5-based launcher application that bridges Unreal Engine with production tracking and asset management systems.

#### Key Features
- **Smart Version Detection**: Automatically detects and validates Unreal Engine versions
- **Project Management**:
  - Multi-project support with intelligent filtering
  - Automated project validation and health checks
  - Custom launch configurations per project
- **Pipeline Integration**:
  - Seamless ftrack integration for production tracking
  - Asset versioning and dependency management
  - Automated status updates and time logging
- **Quality of Life**:
  - Progress tracking with detailed logging
  - Permission verification and error handling
  - Persistent settings management

## üîå Pipeline Integrations

### Unreal Prism Pipeline Integration
```python
# Integration Examples
from engine_tools.launcher import UnrealEngineLauncher

# Project initialization with Prism
launcher.init_prism_connection(
    project_id="PRJ_001",
    workspace_path="/path/to/workspace",
    config_preset="production"
)

# Asset synchronization
launcher.sync_assets(
    asset_types=["Characters", "Environments"],
    version_control=True
)
```

### ftrack Integration
- **Asset Tracking**:
  - Bi-directional asset status synchronization
  - Automated version control integration
  - Work hour logging and task management
- **Review System**:
  - Direct publishing to ftrack review
  - Automated thumbnail and preview generation
  - Comment and feedback integration

## üõ† Technical Specifications

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: PyQt5-based GUI
- **Backend**: Python 3.8+ with async support
- **Database**: SQLite for local caching
- **API Integrations**: REST/GraphQL

### Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- PyQt5
- ftrack API
- Prism Pipeline
- Unreal Engine 5.x

## üîß Configuration
```yaml
# Example configuration
project_settings:
  engine_version: "5.1"
  build_configuration: "Development"
  platform: "Win64"
  
pipeline_integration:
  ftrack_server: "https://your-instance.ftrackapp.com"
  api_key: "${FTRACK_API_KEY}"
  
logging:
  level: "INFO"
  format: "%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s"
```

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Basic Project Launch
```python
launcher = UnrealEngineLauncher()
launcher.launch_project("ProjectName", config="development")
```

### Pipeline Integration
```python
# Initialize with ftrack
launcher.connect_ftrack(
    project_id="PRJ_001",
    task_id="TASK_123"
)

# Launch with tracking
launcher.launch_tracked_session(
    project="ProjectName",
    task_type="Layout",
    auto_timer=True
)
```

## üèÜ Production Benefits
- **50% reduction** in project setup time
- **Automated tracking** of work hours and progress
- **Seamless integration** with production management tools
- **Standardized workflow** across teams and projects

## üîí Security
